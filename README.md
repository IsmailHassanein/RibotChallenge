RibotChallenge
==============
The Developer Challenge
(hopefully more fun than challenging)

Your mission (should you wish to accept) is to create a piece of software about us, the ribots! You should make something which best showcases the skills you have to offer. An Android app, HTML5 web application or iOS project - whichever best demonstrates the skills for the job you’ve applied for.
To help you out, we’ve written a simple REST API for you to utilise. It returns data in JSON format, which you can use to create your masterpiece. You can find all the documentation, along with the code at this Github URL:
https://github.com/ribot/riAPI

What we’re expecting
The application you create doesn’t need to be too complicated; something which lists all the ribots and that you can click through to gain more information will do. What we’re assessing is the quality of your code and your way of working. To help us with this, we encourage you to do your work in a git repository. You can use other source control software if you wish, but we usually use git. If you need a repository then Github or Bitbucket are good free options.
The best way to submit your code is by sending us either a link to a public git repository. Make sure you include a readme which lists any required libraries or software which we need installed, and clear instructions to compile and run it. Also include a brief description of how you developed your application and any areas that you feel might need some improvement.
